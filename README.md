# GameOfLife

John Conway's Game of Life is a well known problem in the programming world. Developed in 1970, it is a zero-player game and Turing complete. 

The basic rules are as follows:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies.
- Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies.
- Any dead cell with 3 live neighbors is regenerated.

## Motivation

Conway's Game of Life is frequently implemented when studying algorithms. I wanted to put a unique twist on this interesting problem, by building it in React. It was my first introduction to cellular automation and was a blast to build.  

## Build status
